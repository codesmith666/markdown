### Formatted

Four spaces in front of the string will result in a formatted display.

This is similar to the plaintext specification of a block.

```
    pre1
      pre1-1
      pre1-2
    pre2
```

    pre1
      pre1-1
      pre1-2
    pre2

### Force break

Two spaces at the end of a line are line breaks.

```
abc[sp][sp]
def
```

abc  
def
